We want to bring the creative and exciting back into rational explanations and explore the boundaries between technology and humans or science and magic.\r\n\r\n### Ronan Whitteker\r\nfor more information contact Ronan at ronan.whitteker@gmail.com\r\n\r\n### See our other projects:\r\nwww.aftermath.co.nz\r\nwww.overcomplete.info\r\n",
